## How To Play
After launching the game, you will see some blanks. Each represents a letter from the random word.
Type a letter to guess if it is in the random word.
Each time you guess an incorrect letter, your "Guesses Remaining" will reduce by 1. Once this reaches zero, you lose!
If you guess the random word before exhausting your guesses remaining, you win!
At the win/loss screen, you may play again by hitting the enter key, or you can exit by typing "n" or "no."
